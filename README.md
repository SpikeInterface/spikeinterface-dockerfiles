# spikeinterface-dockerfiles

Docker recipes for various spike sorters, [hosted on dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/u/spikeinterface).

These are base docker images that are used in at least two projects

  * [spikeforest](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/spikeforest)
  * [spikeinterface](https://github.com/spikeinterface)

These images are minimalistic in that they contain only what is needed to run the installed sorter (no wrappers included).
